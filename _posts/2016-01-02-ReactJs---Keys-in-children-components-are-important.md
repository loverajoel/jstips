The [key](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html#dynamic-children) is an attribute that you must pass to all components created dynamically from an array. It's unique and constant id that React use for identify each component in the DOM and know that it's a different component and not the same one. Using keys will ensure that the child component is preserved and not recreated and prevent that weird things happens.

> Key is not really about performance, it's more about identity (which in turn leads to better performance). randomly assigned and changing values are not identity [Paul O’Shannessy](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1342#issuecomment-39230939)

- Use an existing unique value of the object.
- Define the keys in the parent components, not in child components

	```javascript
	//bad
	...
	render() {
		<div key={{item.key}}>{{item.name}}</div>
	}
	...

	//good
	<MyComponent key={{item.key}}/>
	```

- `random()` will not work

	```javascript
	//bad
	<MyComponent key={{Math.random()}}/>
	```

- You can create your own unique id, be sure that the method be fast and attach it to your object.
- When the amount of child are big or involve expensive components, use keys has performance improvements.
