The `querySelectorAll` method returns an array-like object called a node list. These data structures are referred to as "Array-like", because they appear as an array, but can not be used with array methods like `map` and `forEach`. Here's a quick, safe, and reusable way to convert a node list into an array of DOM elements:

```javascript
const nodelist = document.querySelectorAll('div');
const nodelistToArray = Array.apply(null, nodelist);

//later on ..

nodelistToArray.forEach(...);
nodelistToArray.map(...);
nodelistToArray.slice(...);

//etc...
```

The `apply` method is used to pass an array of arguments to a function with a given `this` value. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply) states that `apply` will take an array-like object, which is exactly what `querySelectorAll` returns. Since we don't need to specify a value for `this` in the context of the function, we pass in `null` or `0`. The result is an actual array of DOM elements which contains all of the available array methods.

Or if you are using ES2015 you can use the [spread operator `...`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator)

```js
const nodelist = [...document.querySelectorAll('div')]; // returns a real array

//later on ..

nodelist.forEach(...);
nodelist.map(...);
nodelist.slice(...);

//etc...
```
