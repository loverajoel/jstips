title: Use === instead of ==

tip-tldr: The `==` (or `!=`) operator performs an automatic type conversion if needed. The `===` (or `!==`) operator will not perform any conversion. It compares the value and the type, which could be considered faster ([jsPref](http://jsperf.com/strictcompare)) than `==`.

The `==` (or `!=`) operator performs an automatic type conversion if needed. The `===` (or `!==`) operator will not perform any conversion. It compares the value and the type, which could be considered faster ([jsPref](http://jsperf.com/strictcompare)) than `==`.

```js
[10] ==  10      // is true
[10] === 10      // is false

'10' ==  10      // is true
'10' === 10      // is false

 []  ==  0       // is true
 []  === 0       // is false

 ''  ==  false   // is true but true == "a" is false
 ''  === false   // is false 

```
