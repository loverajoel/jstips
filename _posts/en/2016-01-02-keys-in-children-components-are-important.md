title: Keys in children components are important

tip-tldr: The key is an attribute that you must pass to all components created dynamically from an array. It's a unique and constant id that React uses to identify each component in the DOM and to know whether it's a different component or the same one. Using keys ensures that the child component is preserved and not recreated and prevents weird things from happening.

The [key](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/multiple-components.html#dynamic-children) is an attribute that you must pass to all components created dynamically from an array. It's a unique and constant id that React uses to identify each component in the DOM and to know whether it's a different component or the same one. Using keys ensures that the child component is preserved and not recreated and prevents weird things from happening.

> Key is not really about performance, it's more about identity (which in turn leads to better performance). Randomly assigned and changing values do not form an identity [Paul Oâ€™Shannessy](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1342#issuecomment-39230939)

- Use an existing unique value of the object.
- Define the keys in the parent components, not in child components

```javascript
//bad
...
render() {
	<div key={{item.key}}>{{item.name}}</div>
}
...

//good
<MyComponent key={{item.key}}/>
```

- `random()` will not work

```javascript
//bad
<MyComponent key={{Math.random()}}/>
```

- You can create your own unique id. Be sure that the method is fast and attach it to your object.
- When the number of children is large or contains expensive components, use keys to improve performance.
