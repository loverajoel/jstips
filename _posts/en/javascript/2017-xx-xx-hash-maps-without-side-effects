When you want to use javascript object as a hash map(purely for storing data), you might want to create it as follows.

```js
  const map = Object.create(null);
```

When creating a map using object literal(`const map = {}`), the map inherites properties from Object by default. It is equivalent to `Object.create(Object.prototype)`.

But by doing `Object.create(null)`, we explicitly specify `null` as its prototype. So it have absolutely no properties, not even constructor, toString, hasOwnProperty, etc. so you're free to use those keys in your data structure if you need to.

**Rationale:-**
```js
const dirtyMap = {};
const cleanMap = Object.create(null);

dirtyMap.constructor    // function Object() { [native code] }

cleanMap.constructor    // undefined

//iterating maps

const key;
for(key in dirtyMap){
  if (dirtyMap.hasOwnProperty(key)) {   // Check to avoid iterating over inherited properties.
    console.log(key + " -> " + dirtyMap[key]);
  }
}

for(key in cleanMap){
  console.log(key + " -> " + cleanMap[key]);    // No need to add extra checks, as the object will always be clean
}
```

**Note**: 
* Object.create() was introduced in ES5 [[Compatibility]](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/)
* ES6 introduced some new structures: [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map), [WeakMap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap), [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) and [Weak Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakSet)
