The ternary operator is a shortcut for the `if` statement. It consists of three operands; a question mark, a condition, and an expression to execute if the condition is true, followed by a colon and another expression to execute if itâ€™s false.

```js
let age = 26;

// condition ? expression if true : expression if false
let drink = (age >= 21) ? "Beer" : "Juice";

console.log(drink); // "Beer"

// Equivalent to:
let drink;
if ((age >= 21)) {
  drink = "Beer";
} else {
  drink = "Juice";
}

console.log(drink); // "Beer"
```
