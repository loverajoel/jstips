# Introducing Javascript Tips
> New year, new project. **A JS tip per day!**

With great excitement, I introduce short and useful Javascript tips per day that will allow you to improve your code writing. With less than 2 minutes each day, you will be able to read about performance, frameworks, conventions, hacks, interview questions and all the items that future of this awesome language holds for us.

At midday, no matter if it is a weekend or a holiday, a tip will be posted and tweeted.

Just to give you a glance, this is an example of how the tips would be like.

## Insert item inside an Array
> 12/29/2015

Insert an item into an existing array is a daily common task. You can add elements to the end of an array using push, to the beginning using unshift, or the middle using splice.

But those are known methods, doesn't mean there isn't a more performant way, here we go...

Add a element at the end of the array is easy with push(), but there is a way more performant.

```javascript
var arr = [1,2,3,4,5];

arr.push(6);
arr[arr.length] = 6; // 43% faster in Chrome 47.0.2526.106 on Mac OS X 10.11.1
```
Both methods modify the original array. Don't believe me? Check the [jsperf](http://jsperf.com/push-item-inside-an-array)

Now we are trying to add a item to the beginning of the array

```javascript
var arr = [1,2,3,4,5];

arr.unshift(0);
[0].concat(arr); // 98% faster in Chrome 47.0.2526.106 on Mac OS X 10.11.1
```
Here is a little bit detail, unshift edit the original array, concat return a new array. [jsperf](http://jsperf.com/unshift-item-inside-an-array)

Add items at the middle of an array is easy with splice and is the most performant way to do it.

```javascript
var items = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four'];
items.splice(items.length / 2, 0, 'hello');
```
I tried to run these tests in various Browsers and OS and the results were similar. I hope this tips will be useful for you and encorage to perform your own tests! 

## Prefer the Triple-Equals Operator
> 12/30/2015 by [madhur](https://github.com/madhur)

A concept that any beginning developer of JavaScript needs to know is the difference between the double and triple equals. With a double equals comparison operator JavaScript will be a lot more lenient with the outcome. 

```javascript
var x = 51;
var str = "51";
if(x == str) {
    console.log("Somewhat lol");
} else {
    alert("WRONG");
}
```

With the double equals, the if statement will return true and the first block will be executed. However if there was a triple equals in the same example.

```javascript
var x = 51;
var str = "51";
if(x === str) {
    console.log("Somewhat lol");
} else {
    alert("WRONG");
}
```

The alert would pop up instead. The reason being the triple equals will not convert the type of the values; making it more strict and therefore better in most situations.
