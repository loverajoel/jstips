# How to submit your tip

To submit a tip to the list, fork the repository and add your tip to a new file in the correct folder (according language).  The name of the file should be `2016-xx-xx-name-of-your-tip`.

Use [this format](https://github.com/loverajoel/jstips/blob/gh-pages/POST_TEMPLATE.md) when writing your tip. Your tip should be readable in less than two minutes. You may add links to other sites or videos that give more insight if you wish.

Once your tip is ready, [issue a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with this [PR template](https://github.com/loverajoel/jstips/blob/gh-pages/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and your tip will be reviewed. Every day one tip will be merged from the available pull requests.

# Notes

Leave the date and the tip number with **xx**. When we decide to merge the pull request, you will add them and squash your commits.

# Tip flow

**Tip sent** -> **Tip in review** -> **Tip Approved**

- When you send a tip, it now has to pass the review process and while that happens, it status will be `under-review`.
- After the tip is reviewed by 5 people and they gave their :shipit:, then the tip will be `ready to merge`
